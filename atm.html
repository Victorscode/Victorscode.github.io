        <h2>Gold letters</h2>
        <p>In the beginning of the 7th grade we were working in Photoshop and we made Gold letters. While we were doing this I found photoshop very interesting and difficult at times</p>

        <h2>Google animals</h2>
         <p> This was a somewhat easy project but it was one of my favorite subjects in ATM. I wish we could do projects like this in 8th grade ATM. </p>

        <h2>Soccer</h2> 
         <p> I have been playing soccer mostly all of my life and it is a really cool sport. I have practices every monday and wednesdays I also have practices on fridays with another team  </p>

         <h2>Fire letters</h2>
         <p>The fire letters was in the same time as the gold letters but I enjoyed making the Fire letters more. The fire letters were easier to make unlike the gold letters.
